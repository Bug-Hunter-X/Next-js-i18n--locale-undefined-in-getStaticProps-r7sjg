The problem was solved by verifying the `i18n` configuration in `next.config.js` and ensuring the locales defined there matched the URLs used.  If static generation was not strictly required, switching to `getServerSideProps` allowed access to the `router.locale`.  See the solution file for updated `next.config.js` and corrected `getStaticProps` or updated implementation using `getServerSideProps`.
